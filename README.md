# Description

### Why use mostrosity vim?
- If you suffer with understanding how vim works and want to learn a lot, Mostrority is for You.
- If you want a upgradable config that has the basics but is not bloated, Mostrosity is for You
- If you want a sane file structure that is understandable and usable by everyone then Mostrosity is for **YOU**!

**This is a config For you to build on**


### Why make this?
The reason of making this project is very simple. I was using [Lunar Vim](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/LunarVim/tree/master) by [Christian Chiarulli](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli) but I was not satisfied because I wanted to learn to make one myself. Also so many updates started to happen and I couldn't keep up. So here it is a Neo Vim config made by me but inspired heavily in Lunar Vim. ( Almost all the code is from there just re worked it)



# How to Use Mostrosity Vim?
1. Install in one command

$ one liner goes here

Sourcing I am refering of the stack of calling require on lua files.
