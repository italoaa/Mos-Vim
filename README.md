### Why use mostrosity vim?
If you suffer with understanding how vim works and want to learn a lot, Mostrority is for You.
If you want a upgradable config that has the basics but is not bloated, Mostrosity is for You
If you want a sane file structure that is understandable and usable by everyone then Mostrosity is for **YOU**!

**This is a config For you to build on**


### Why make this?
The reason of making this project is very simple. I was using Lunar Vim by <--> but I was not satisfied because I wanted to learn to make one, also there started to happen many updates and I couldn't keep up. So here it is a Neo Vim config made by me but inspired heavily in Lunar Vim.
